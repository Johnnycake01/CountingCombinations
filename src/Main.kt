    /*
    Task
Write a function that counts how many different ways you can make change for an amount of money given an array of coin denominations. For example, there are 3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomination 1 and 2:

1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 2+2.
The order of coins does not matter:

1+1+2 == 2+1+1
Also, assume that you have an infinite ammount of coins.

Your function should take an amount to change and an array of unique denominations for the coins.

Specification
Challenge.countChange(money, coins)
Parameters
money: Int - Number to make change for

coins: Array<Int> - Array of denominations

Return Value
Int - Number of ways change can be made

Examples
money	coins	Return Value
4	    [1,2]	    3
10  	[5,2,3]	    4
11	    [5,7]	    0

    fun countChange(money: Int, coins: ArrayList<Int>): Int {

        return 0
